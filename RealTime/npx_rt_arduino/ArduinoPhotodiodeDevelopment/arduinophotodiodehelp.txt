Set-up:
- Connect photodiode to breadboard plug in and pin to Vcc and ground.
- Connect wires to analog out and ground on breadboard and attach to BNC
	if trying to view on oscilloscope:
		-use t connector to connect this to both the arduino analog input and oscilloscope
		-Connect Arduino digital output to oscilloscope
Code:
- Idea is to take a running average and determine when the average is changed significantly as the signal from the photodiode resembles a square wave where average should decrease significantly when visuali stimuli starts
- initialize input and output pins, initial value for analog input variable, number of samples to take average over, list to hold samples, total, and average
- read in analog input from photodiode as val
- subtract the oldest input from the list storing values to average and replace with val
- take the average of all items in the list 
- adjust the index
- if the average is changed significantly(adding this point to the average caused it to decrease significantly as high stimuli means lower output value) then output high
- when there is no significant change in average output low
	- this outputs a signal which has a peak when the visual stimuli start\
- set x to represent the current average so it can be compared to the next average 
-flag represents monkey fixation given by digital input signals
-flag=1 means monkey is fixating so it is a requirement also for the signal to be high
